# 🍽️ Chef Must Cook

## 🌌 Lore

A boy with no name has died.

He awakens in a strange, dreamlike realm — the **Resurrection Realm**. There, two spirits await him: **Mentari** ☀️ and **Rembulan** 🌙. They are cats, yet more than cats — gentle, ancient guides. They tell him that to return to life, he must first help others still living on Earth. His task is simple, yet profound:

**Cook food for those in need.**

Each dish he creates becomes a reflection of thought, emotion, memory — a manifestation of will. When crafted with care, these dishes can echo through reality and subtly change the lives of those who are suffering.

As he cooks, memories return.

He remembers his mother. He remembers the kitchen, the warmth of porridge on the stove. He remembers the words they used to say together, whispering it like a promise through hunger and hardship: **"Chef Must Cook."**

He remembers the man — not his father — the one who used them. Who shouted. Who hit. The day came when the shouting turned into something worse. His mother, still trying to cook, was struck down before his eyes.

In panic and rage, he remembered the porridge recipe from TV. He hurled the boiling pot from the stove at the man. And then he ran — his cat in his arms — out into the cold night, injured, shaking, alone.

The burning pain in his hand made him collapse beneath a tree. Snow in his lungs. He clung to one thought: **Chef Must Cook.** But he never stood up again.

Until now.

A shimmering silhouette, weeping light — a presence like crystal and compassion — held him gently and brought him here. (Unknown to him, she was **Pink Diamond** 💎.)

Now he stands once more. Whole. Healing. Guided by the spirits of cats and memory. He will cook again. Not just to return — but to change the world he left behind.

With each dish, he sees the lives of others begin to shift. Small ripples. New chances. Hope.

Because no matter what — **Chef Must Cook.**

## 🚧 Under Development

This game is still in **heavy development**. The developer didn’t realize how big the vision was, and they're learning along the way 😓. There’s no win condition yet. It's still rough. Just a simulation of a greater dream.

But if you feel like it, step into the kitchen. Try to make something beautiful 🌱.

More chapters, foods, polish, multiplayer, and a real ending are planned. Someday.

## For now, just remember: **Chef Must Cook.** 🔥

## ✅ UAS

Added Balancing: buat win condition yang lebih mudah atau untuk setiap step ada checkpoint sehingga player mendapatkan feedback positif dari melakukan step yang sesuai resep. Now it has audio and win condition and checkpoint that gives positive feedbacks! There are a lot to add TT and even though it didn't pass my expectations, i have to know my scope and limits, so i sacrifice some of the UI aspects aesthetics to make sure the logics are superb! I wish i could work more on this, but i think i have enough of Godot 3D Physics because i've tried to fix this game countless times! So i'm moving on to improve this game on roblox, wish me luck! Thank you so much for the learning opportunities and now i'm a fullstack game developer YAHAAA!!!!!!
